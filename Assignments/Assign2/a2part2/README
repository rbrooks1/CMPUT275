Accessories: arduino board

Server:

    running instructions:
    to run the server move to the correct directory and type make into the
    terminal

    notes:
    The data structure holding the vertices for the paths from the start to end vertex
    deletes itself between functions.  The cause for this was unable to be identified,
    however if this problem was not present then the coordinates would be sent through
    the serial connection based on the order of the vertex in the data structure.
    It was observed that all vertices between the starting and end points were found and
    stored into the data structure, however, they disappeared without a delete command during
    runtime.
    All line length and c-style style errors were ignored.

Client:

    Wiring instructions:
    
    TFT Display:

    The display pins are numbered left to right in this document when they are being viewed
    with their labels showing rightside up. Note you do not require the touchscreen for this assignment,
    so it is probably a lot easier to not wire the Y+/X+/Y-/X- pins.

    Display Pin     Arduino Mega Pin
    1 GND           BB GND bus
    2 Vin           BB Vcc (+ive) bus

    4 CLK           Pin 52
    5 MISO          Pin 50
    6 MOSI          Pin 51
    7 CS            Pin 10
    8 D/C           Pin 9

    19 CCS          Pin 6

Zoom in and out buttons:

    Button          Arduino Mega Pin
    Zoom In         Pin 2
    Zoom Out        Pin 3

Joystick connections:

    Joystick Pin    Arduino Mega Pin
    +5v             Vcc
    GND             GND
    VRx             Analog 1
    VRy             Analog 0
    SW              Pin 8
    
    running instructions:
    To run the client code move to the directory containing the client.cpp file and type
    make upload.  Use the joystick to move and click the joystick to select start and end
    points.  Click the buttons to change the zoom of the map.

    notes:
    The zoom buttons do not work for some reason and if you zoom into the highest zoom
    will cause the cursor to create a trail.  It has been stated by an instructor that this
    does not need to be fixed.
    All length and c-style style errors were ignored.
