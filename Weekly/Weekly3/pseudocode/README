included files: textmatch.cpp
                flipflop.cpp
                README

running instructions:
to run the .cpp files move to the local directory and use
g++ <code>.cpp, where <code> is the name of the program, and then tyoe
./a.out
if you want to run the code using the test centre, simply put the code
in the soln folder of the appropriate test centre zip file and in the folder
containing the soln folder run ./optestcenter,sh in the terminal.

assumptions:
for flipflop.cpp:
math.h was used for the ceil function
for textmatch.cpp:
cstring was used for strlen
ignored c-style casting and variable length array style errors
