Course: CMPUT 275 winter 2019
assignment: Weekly exercise 5: graph concepts

included files: count_components.cpp
                edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
                makefile
                README

running instructions:
to run count_components.cpp simply move to the directory containing all the files
mentioned in the README (as well as including the Digraph.h and Digraph.cpp files)
and in the terminal type make then type ./count_components.  This will return the
connected components of the textfile in the main function of the .cpp file.

assumptions:
The code is currently using the edmonton-road-2.0.1.txt file to test both the graph creation
and the connected components counting.  To test on a different file simply change the textFile
variable name in the main function and it will create and count the components of a graph
using a new textfile.
