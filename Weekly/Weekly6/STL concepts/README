assignment: Weekly exercise 6: STL concepts

included files: student_hash.cpp
                complex_postfix.cpp
                makefile
                README

running instructions:
to run complex_postfix.cpp simply navigate through the terminal
to the directory containing all the files described in the included
files section and type either make, make all, or make calc.  Afterwards
type ./calc to run the program.
to run student_hash.cpp do the same as for complex_postfix, but
instead type make all, make student, or make and the type ./student
to run the program.

Assumptions:
for both files all c++ vs c style errors and all length errors were
ignored as the do not change the functionality of the code.
for complex_postfix.cpp all style errors pertaining to extra space before
function call were ignored (these had to do with the declaration of a pair
and the variable associated with it)
for student_hash.cpp do not indent within a namespace error and potential indentation
error were ignored as they do not affect the functionality of the code.

Acknowledgments:
Thank you to:
Jason Cannon for help with stack.pop vs stack.top and for help overloading the == operator
Everton Schumacker soares for help with typedef declaration and type declaration of
the stack.
