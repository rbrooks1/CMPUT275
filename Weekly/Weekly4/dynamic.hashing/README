Course: CMPUT 275 winter 2019
assignment: Weekly exercise 4: Dynamic hashing and makefile

included files: hashtable.h
                linkedlist.h
                exercise4.cpp
                makefile
                README

running instructions:
to run exercise4.cpp simply move to the directory containing all the files
mentioned in the included files section of this document and in your terminal
type make to compile and link the files together.  Afterwards type ./exercise4
to run the program.

assumptions:
If you are passing no argument to the creation of the hashtable class please remove
the brackets (i.e. if you are creating a hashtable class with no arguments
please use table and not table()) also I could not style check the .h files
and as well I style checked the .cpp fileas it does not affect the functionality
of the code. I also was not sure if I needed to put a file header in the .cpp file,
the nakefile, and the linkedlist.h file so I did not (it was not mentioned in the exercise).
I only put a file header in the hashtable.h file.

Acknowledgements:
Thank you to Touqir Sajed for help with this code.
