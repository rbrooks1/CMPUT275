Course: CMPUT 275 winter 2019
assignment: Weekly exercise 7: AVL trees

included files: avlaux.h
                avlmap.h
                ex7test.cpp
                makefile
                README

running instructions:
To run the code simply move to the directory containing all the included files
in the terminal and type make then type ,/ex7test.out to run the executable.  You
can use a file as your test by typing ./ex7test.out > <filename> in the terminal or
you can simply follow the instructions after running the executable.

Assumptions:
Could not style check the .h files and as such I have not edited the code for style.
I hope the style is correct.
